The two sample tarballs have text files formatted differently for
Mac (and Unix), and a different version for Windows.  If you're on
Windows and transfer your files to CAEN, you should grab the Mac/Unix
version of the files for running on CAEN.

The new data structure that you'll need for Project 3 is the
unordered_map<>.  We'll be talking about how it works the very
first day back after the long weekend, but we didn't want you to have
to wait to start on your project until May 29.  Look up the online
documentation on the unordered_map<>, and also look at the example
file on Canvas / Files / Sample Code / umap_demo.cpp (taken from the
Lecture 15 slides) and wordcount.cpp.
